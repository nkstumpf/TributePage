                <hr>
                <p>Jason Eli Becker (born July 22, 1969) is an American musician, songwriter and composer. At the age of
                    16, he became part of the Shrapnel Records-produced duo Cacophony with his friend Marty Friedman.
                    They released the albums Speed Metal Symphony in 1987 and Go Off! in 1988. Cacophony broke up in
                    1989 and Becker began doing solo work, having released his first album Perpetual Burn in 1988, also
                    through Shrapnel. He later joined David Lee Roth's band and recorded one album with him, A Little
                    Ain't Enough.</p>

                <p>Becker's performing career was cut short by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In 1996, Becker lost
                    the ability to speak, and he now communicates with his eyes via a system developed by his father.
                    Despite his disability, he continues composing by using a computer and has since released with
                    Shrapnel Collection, a "best of" album of his favorite songs and three new songs.</p>

                    <p>Becker was born and raised in Richmond, California, by his parents, Gary and Patricia (Heffley)
                        Becker. He was born in Richmond Hospital on 23rd Street in 1969. His maternal grandfather was
                        actor Wayne Heffley.[2] Becker graduated from Kennedy High School where he performed Yngwie
                        Malmsteen's "Black Star" with his band at a talent show. [1] While still in high school, Becker
                        was introduced to Marty Friedman. He was exposed to the guitar at an early age because both his
                        father and his uncle were guitar players. He absorbed all kinds of music from around the world
                        and melded different aspects of each style into his playing. He cited Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton,
                        Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen as early influences.</p>

            <h4>Cacophony and solo career</h4>

                <div id="flex-item-3">
                    <p>Becker started out playing alongside Marty Friedman in the Mike Varney-produced duo, Cacophony.
                        Together, they put out an album, and toured Japan and the U.S. While they never went mainstream
                        in the U.S., they proved popular enough in Europe to sell out almost every performance. [2] In
                        1989 Friedman left to join Megadeth and Becker began to pursue a solo career, having released
                        his first solo album titled Perpetual Burn in 1988. He has since released the albums Perspective
                        and Collection, as well as two albums of demos, entitled The Raspberry Jams and The Blackberry
                        Jams.</p>

            <h4>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</h4>
            <hr>
            <div class="flex">
                <div id="flex-item-5">
                    <p>At the age of 20, he joined David Lee Roth's band to work on Roth's album A Little Ain't Enough,
                        replacing Steve Vai, who had joined Whitesnake. In 1990 Becker won the coveted Best New
                        Guitarist award from Guitar Magazine. [3] While preparing for the album, Becker began to feel
                        what he called a "lazy limp" in his left leg. He was soon diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral
                        sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig's Disease) and was given three to five years to live. He finished the
                        recording using lighter (thinner) gauge guitar strings and other techniques, which made it
                        easier for him to play with his weakening hands. Although he managed to finish the album, which
                        was released in 1991, he did not join the supporting tour due to his inability to perform on
                        stage; former Lizzy Borden guitarist Joe Holmes took Becker's place on tour.</p>

                    <p>His ALS gradually robbed him of his ability to play guitar, to walk, and eventually his ability
                        to speak. He now communicates with his eyes via a system developed by his father. Due to the
                        nature of the disease, he remains mentally sharp and, with the aid of a computer, continues
                        composing. In the back of the Perspective CD case, Becker states "I have Amyotrophic Lateral
                        Sclerosis. It has crippled my body and speech, but not my mind." His medical condition has
                        remained stable since 1997. In 2003, Becker posted on his website that he was feeling better and
                        had gained some weight, while the folder for his 2008 album Collection also mentions an upcoming
                        book.</p>

            <h4>Perspective and the Berry Jams</h4>

                <div id="flex-item-7">
                    <p>In 1996, Becker released an album entitled Perspective, an instrumental album composed by him
                        (with the exception of Bob Dylan's song "Meet Me in the Morning"). The writing of the music had
                        been started before ALS completely crippled his abilities. By using guitar, and, later, when he
                        was unable to use both hands, a keyboard, he continued to compose while his disease worsened.
                        However, when Becker could no longer physically play even a keyboard, his friend and music
                        producer Mike Bemesderfer helped him with a music-composing computer program that reads
                        movements of his head and eyes, enabling Becker to continue to compose after he lost control of
                        the rest of his body.</p>

                    <p>Several years later, Becker released Raspberry Jams (1999) and Blackberry Jams (2003); the first
                        contained various unreleased demo-tracks, and the latter contained demo-tracks and alternate
                        versions of songs that were later reworked and published into other albums.</p>

                    <p>Two tribute albums to Jason Becker have been issued. Respectively entitled Warmth in the
                        Wilderness I and Warmth in the Wilderness II, they feature guitarists such as Steve Vai, Paul
                        Gilbert, Marty Friedman, Joe Becker, Rusty Cooley, and Mattias Eklundh. The album profits were
                        sent to Becker to help him with his medical finances.</p>
